# TODO

## Objectives

The goals of this project are defined as follows:
1. Build an image classified to identify the style of a painting.
2. The final product must be web-based and allow the users their own pictures.
3. The final API will also includes logs (training and prediction) to ensure continuous monitoring of the project.

## Data

[WikiArt](https://www.wikiart.org/) is our data source. This domain presents both public domain and copyright protected artworks. WikiArt is a very popular source of data for Machine Learning applications. Indeed, data retrieval is relatively easy and existing python libraries have already been developed.

## Load Data

The data is retrieved using a web scrapper from [Lucas David](https://github.com/lucasdavid/wikiart).
The content scrapper retrieves all the available information hosted on [WikiArt](https://www.wikiart.org/).
