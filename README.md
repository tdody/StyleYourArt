## Objectives

The goals of this project are defined as follows:
1. Build an image classifier to identify the style of a painting.
2. The final product must be web-based and allow the users their own pictures.
3. The final API will present the results of the prediction (plot) and suggest additional information to the user (similar paintings, famous artists)

## Data

[WikiArt](https://www.wikiart.org/) is our data source. This domain presents both public domain and copyright protected artworks. WikiArt is a very popular source of data for Machine Learning applications. Indeed, data retrieval is relatively easy and existing python libraries have already been developed.

## Load Data

The data is retrieved using a web scrapper from [Lucas David](https://github.com/lucasdavid/wikiart).
The content scrapper retrieves all the available information hosted on [WikiArt](https://www.wikiart.org/).
